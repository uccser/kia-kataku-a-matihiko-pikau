# Introduction

{comment Māui: surely there’s a better way to do this?}

If you had to find an envelope in an unsorted list of 100, how many envelopes would you expect to have to look at?
On average?
In the worst case?
In the best case?

What you’re doing here is evaluating an algorithm.
We’ll define algorithms more carefully later on, but an algorithm is essentially the process that you choose to use.
With an unsorted pile of envelopes, any process will involve going through all of the envelopes!

This is just one idea for an algorithm that speeds up the time it takes to get people onto a plane.
You might like to explore other ideas that people have tried, such as loading “window-middle-aisle”, or by groups.

Try this with your students: give each group of three students one pile of about 50 numbers or words, and ask them to sort the pile into order.
See what strategies they develop to do it as quickly as possible, sharing the work around the group.
Teams of students could race each other.
They also need to figure out how they can check that the result is correct (you can get one team to check another team’s results - all they need to do is find two adjacent cards that are out of order).
There isn’t a “right” way of doing this, but some methods will be faster than others, and it’s the reflection on how they did it where computational thinking is happening.
