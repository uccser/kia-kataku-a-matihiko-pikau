# Wrapping up

This Pīkau/toolkit has given a short introduction to the idea of computational thinking.
We’ll go into more detail in a second Pīkau/toolkit that explores a more international view of the concept.
A lot of this will become clearer as you engage with further Pīkau/toolkits about teaching computational thinking.
