# Concepts

This is the show and tell part of the learning where information is transmitted to the student.
The students observe by reading, watching or listening.

Always try to intersperse content with activity.

You will need to keep a separate list of glossary items to pass on to the educational designer.
Highlight the glossary words so that they can easily be identified.
Once the course goes online, these words will show in a pop up when the students hovers over a particular term.
