# Where to next?

The readiness programme has two main supports for exploring digital technologies and getting prepared to teach it:

The first set of supports consists of:
- the website Kia Takatū a- Matihiko:
- Te Tokorima-a-Mahuika | The online self review tool,
- Pīkau | Toolkits.

The second set of supports are the face to face and collaborative components:
- Ki te Ahikāroa | Local meet ups
- Ngā Kiriahi | Online communities of practice
- Te Pā Pouahi | The Digital Leaders programme and the digital leaders courses/pouahi.

These have been developed with the aim of a personalised feel and approach that will engage and sustain your long-term learning journey, about and with digital technologies, to reach the ultimate goal: being ready to effectively implement this new content by 2020.

If you want some background reading:

- [This report from the Royal Society in 2012](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/education/computing-in-schools/2012-01-12-computing-in-schools.pdf) explains the thinking that catalysed the introduction of the equivalent curriculum in England.
- The [following talk by Hinerangi Edwards and Tim Bell](https://vimeo.com/228628929) in Rotorua was given during the consultation before the design of the new curriculum was finalised. It touches on many of the topics discussed in this pīkau/toolkit.
- This [collection of videos](http://www.digipubs.vic.edu.au/curriculum/digitaltechnologies/digital-technologies-curriculum_why) was put together in Australia to support the introduction of Digital Technologies as an area of the Australian curriculum. The videos cover a lot of the ideas around the introduction of Digital Technologies.
