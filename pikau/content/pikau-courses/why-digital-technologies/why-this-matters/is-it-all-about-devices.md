**Activity: Explore a digital view of your own photo**

Try the Pixel viewer demonstrated in the video above by going to the [Computer Science Field Guide – Pixel Value Interactive](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/pixel-viewer/index.html).
You can drop your own photo onto the page to explore the colours in it.

The RGB colour mixer used in the video is from the [Computer Science field Guide – RGB Colour Mixer](http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/rgb-mixer/index.html).
You can use it to see how the three numbers specify the colour.

## Green screening - the hard way!

Arnold the Wonder Parrot

{image end}

This is Arnold the Wonder Parrot, the mascot of the CS Unplugged project.
You can explore this photo of Arnold at the [following link](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/pixel-viewer/index.html?hide-menu&no-pixel-fill&image=arnold.jpg), but it doesn’t have the colours visible, just their numbers.
Can you see where the edge of the green is?
(The G value will be high, and R and B will be low.)
How about Arnold?
(Orange pixels will have a high R and G value.)
What you’re doing manually is green-screening – working out which pixels are the background, and which are the actor in front of the green.

The activity above is looking at green-screen pixels.
This is a good example of the relationship between CT (computational thinking) and DDDO (designing and developing digital outcomes).
In DDDO, students use existing software to do green-screening to create new digital outcomes, while in CT, students would consider how to design an algorithm to do the green-screening.
