# How are your students better off?

{comment Mahuika: How do we look after our students?}

You may have heard people say that young people know all about digital technology.
But many of them **don’t know what they don’t know**, and often they base their views on stereotypes of the field.
A devastating consequence of this is that some of the people most needed in the field don’t even know that it might be an exciting option for them.
Watch these videos from senior tertiary computer science students who nearly missed out on the whole opportunity.

Another concern is that the subject might only appeal to a particular group of students, and shouldn’t be required for everyone.
Have a look at these comments from teachers who have been teaching digital technologies for the last few years.

There’s also the question of how this relates to careers.
Having digital technologies in the curriculum is not all about preparing students for careers, but we hope that some will find that this is their passion.
There are incredible opportunities for employment in this area.
Employees with strong skills in this area (combining technical and “soft” skills) are in short supply in NZ and overseas, especially in software development.
