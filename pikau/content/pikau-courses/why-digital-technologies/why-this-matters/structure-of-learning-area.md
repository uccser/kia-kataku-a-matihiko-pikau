# What’s the structure of the learning area?

{comment Mahuika: What’s the big picture? How does it all fit together?}

Not only is there new terminology to learn about technical topics, but there are also several names to know used for the new areas in the curriculum.
We’ve been using the names already (such as “computational thinking”), but in this module we’ll look at exactly how they fit together.

The following diagram shows how digital technologies fits into The New Zealand Curriculum.
Digital Technologies is part of the technology learning area, and is made up of two “technological areas”.
The full names of the two technological areas are “computational thinking for digital technologies” and “designing and developing digital outcomes”.
These are a bit of a mouthful, so they are sometimes referred to as just “computational thinking”, or CT for short, and digital outcomes, DDDO, or 3DO.
CT and 3DO together are referred to as “digital technologies”, or DT for short.

The other technological areas (material outcomes, processed outcomes, and design and visual communication) have [achievement objectives](http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/The-New-Zealand-Curriculum/Technology/Achievement-objectives).

The new CT and DDDO technological areas use [progress outcomes (PO’s)](http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/The-New-Zealand-Curriculum/Technology/Progress-outcomes), which describe the significant learning steps students take in building their digital capability.

These PO’s link to the New Zealand Curriculum levels giving a broad indication of the approximate stage the learning takes place.
We’ll explore that further in a separate pīkau!

See The New Zealand Curriculum Online:

- [Technology – Achievement objectives](http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/The-New-Zealand-Curriculum/Technology/Achievement-objectives) (for areas other than Digital Technologies)
- [Technology – Progress outcomes](http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/The-New-Zealand-Curriculum/Technology/Progress-outcomes) (for Digital Technologies)
