### Welcome to Kia Takatū a Matihiko | Digital Readiness

This programme prepares you for teaching the new digital technologies curriculum content.

Our aim is to support you to feel confident to effectively implement the new digital technologies content – and to have fun while doing so.
This pīkau | toolkit guides you through how to get the most from the time you are investing into the programme.

**By the end of this pīkau | toolkit, you will be able to:**

- Describe what a pīkau is
- Explain what similarities you have with Māui and Mahuika in your approach to learning about the new digital technologies content

This pīkau | toolkit can be completed by watching the introduction video above, or reading the contents on the next page, then contributing to the discussion in Ngā Kiriahi.
