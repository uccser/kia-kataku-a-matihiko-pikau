# Assessment 1: Open Response

### How do you learn?

You know how you learn best. Are you like M훮ui, just want a brief overview and then time to play? You may like to go through this pikau in a different order to how we deliver it. But we do recommend looking at everything as we have made it all as succinct as possible.

Or are you more like Mahuika, you need to know exactly what is expected of you and how to achieve it. You will probably get the most out of this p카kau by working systematically through it in order.
