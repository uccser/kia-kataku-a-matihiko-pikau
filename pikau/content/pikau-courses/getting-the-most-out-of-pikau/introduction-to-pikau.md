# Introduction to pīkau

At the beginning of each pīkau there will be an introduction section.
It will include a video with information about what is in the pīkau you are about to enter so you can decide if it is the right one for you.
Regardless of if you are working on a pīkau because you are at Hika - ignition, or Whitawhita - blazing, in your digital readiness, we’ll have practical activities that you can implement into your learning space.
You will also know how much time you should put aside to complete the pīkau.

Pīkau means ‘backpack’.
By the end of this readiness program (kiatakatū-ā-matihiko) you’ll have a pīkau/backpack of resources to use for the new content in the Digital Technologies learning area.

Māui

We’d like to acknowledge that we all have different learning styles.
You might be like Māui: curious, a bit of a risk taker, adaptable, playful… You can move around within each pīkau however you like.
Watch all the videos, then do the readings.
You might even want to start with the assessment activities, although we wouldn’t recommend that!

Mahuika

You might be like Mahuika: a protector, patient, insightful.
You might want to work methodically through the pīkau, considering indepth what is being asked of your students.

Or you might be a mixture of both.
Whatever works for you, do that!
We also encourage you to grow and find a balance between the attributes of these two **tipuna**.

We know some of our teachers may be a bit nervous about this new Digital Technologies content, while others could be wondering why it took so long to come in.
Either way, we know you are busy, so we want to maximise your learning through fun, hands-on experiences.
