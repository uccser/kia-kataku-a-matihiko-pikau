# Introduction to pīkau

**Pīkau** means “backpack”. By the end of this readiness program (Kia Takatū ā-Matihiko) you’ll have a pīkau/backpack of resources to use for teaching and learning the new digital technologies content.

## Choosing pīkau | toolkit

At the beginning of each pīkau, there is an introduction.
It includes a video with information about what is in the pīkau so you can decide if it is the right one for you.

Whether you are working on a pīkau at Hika | Ignition, or Whitawhita | Blazing in your digital readiness, we’ll have practical activities that you can implement into your learning space.
You will also know how much time you should put aside to complete the pīkau.

## Learning in a way that suits you

We all learn in in different ways...

**You might be like Māui: curious, a bit of a risk taker, adaptable, playful...**

You can move around within each pīkau | toolkit however you like. Watch all the videos, then do the readings.
You might even want to start with the assessment activities, although we wouldn’t recommend that!

**You might be like Mahuika: a protector, patient, insightful...**

You might want to work methodically through the pīkau | toolkit, considering indepth what is being asked of your students.

**Or you might be a mixture of both...**

Whatever works for you, do that! We also encourage you to grow and find a balance between the attributes of these two tipuna.
We know some of our teachers may be a bit nervous about the new digital technologies content, while others could be wondering why it took so long to come in.
Either way, we know you are busy, so we want to maximise your learning through fun, hands-on experiences – so that’s where we will start!
