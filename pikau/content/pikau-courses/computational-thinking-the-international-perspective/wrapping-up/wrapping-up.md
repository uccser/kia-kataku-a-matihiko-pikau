# Wrapping up

This Pīkau/toolkit is an overview of the topic of computational thinking.
Hopefully you now have some ideas, and know how it’s viewed around the world.
A lot of this will become clearer as you engage with further Pīkau/toolkits --- you’ll be able to explore what programming is (which is a key ingredient in computational thinking).
There are eight Progress Outcomes in the curriculum for computational thinking, and so we’ll be offering the opportunity to explore each of these in a lot more detail in the future.
The Progress Outcomes range from PO 1, where students learn to give and follow very simple instructions, through the later progress outcomes where senior students develop complete programs that take account of the most important part of any design - the person who has to use the system.
