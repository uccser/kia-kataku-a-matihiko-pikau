# An international perspective

Here’s a computational thinking activity that is popular with students, and only needs chalk (or masking tape), some paper, and some space in the playground or classroom to try out.
We’ll use it later to illustrate some ideas.
Here are three different videos showing it in action:
- [A demonstration indoors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30WcPnvfiKE&feature=youtu.be&t=43s)
- [In a show with the network on a mat](https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOxfdsBBjKI?start=139)
- [Outdoors with the network drawn in chalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-z5pDjqtZk)

If you’d like to try a sorting network with your students, [here’s a lesson plan](https://csunplugged.org/en/topics/sorting-networks/unit-plan/).
If your students are engaged with this activity, they are exercising many elements of computational thinking - we’ll show how this relates below; there are also explanations at the end of the lesson plan on the CS Unplugged website showing the mapping to computational thinking.

The first use of the term “Computational Thinking” Activity is generally attributed to [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) who used in in 1980 and 1986 publications.
Papert is known for developing the [programming language Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)).
He was a student of Piaget, who is well known for contribution to theories about education.

The general idea of computational thinking is discussed by [Jeanette Wing in this video](https://youtu.be/YVEUOHw3Qb8?t=12m1s)).
