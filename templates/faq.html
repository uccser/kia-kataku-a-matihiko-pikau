  <h4>Why was this website built?</h4>
  <p>
    This website was built as a supporting tool for authors of the Kia Takatū ā-Matihiko content.
    It incorporates features and practices that we have found useful over our many years of developing content, especially on projects with large amounts of content produced on short time frames.
  </p>

  <h4>Is the content open source? </h4>
  <p>
    Yes, for completed content.
    When content is completed and ready for release, the raw content is stored within the <a href="https://github.com/uccser/kia-takatu-a-matihiko">open source repository for this website on GitHub</a>. The Pīkau content is stored within <code>pikau/content/</code>.
  </p>

  <h4>The website requires a login?</h4>
  <p>
    At the moment we are restricting access to specific pages to project authors, though raw data for completed content can still be accessed (see question above).
    Access to pages may be changed once the project is completed.
  </p>

  <h4>It would be great if you could add a feature to the website that...</h4>
  <p>
    Please let me know any ideas or feature requests you have at <a href="mailto:jack.morgan@kiatakatu.ac.nz">jack.morgan@kiatakatu.ac.nz</a>.
    This website is built to assist you, so I would love to improve it in any way possible.
  </p>

  <h4>I have found a bug on the website!</h4>
  <p>
    Please send an email to <a href="mailto:jack.morgan@kiatakatu.ac.nz">jack.morgan@kiatakatu.ac.nz</a> explaining the bug you found.
    If it's an interface issue then please attach a screenshot.
